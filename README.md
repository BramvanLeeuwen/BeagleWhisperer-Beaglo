# BeagleWhisperer-Beaglo
C++ libraries for TCP/IP communication and controlling and readout ports od the Beaglebone Black from a Windows computer

The Beaglebone Linux program is written in C++ (compiled by GCC).The program is heavy loaded with uncommented print functions for the terminal, to test the various functions. Use the code als a template for your own C++ program. It is built to test the functions, rather. But it's easier to throw away superfluent parts you do not use than build new parts! As it is, it is not meant as a automation program. But you can use it to build such a program. Download the C++ code from the 'Beaglo'-page.
